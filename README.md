# Java-Duplicate_Name_Detection
This Java program detects duplicate names in a user-inputted array. It prompts the user to enter the array size and elements, then iterates through the list to identify and print duplicates. This project demonstrates basic array handling, nested loops, and string comparisons in Java.
